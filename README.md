# AmerisourceBergen - Analytics-Challenge

Both old and new files for Exploratory Data Analyst done for the Temple Analytics Challenge 2018.

The quality of the analysis via Python was not up to my own expectations, and the bulk of the insights had come from other tools. 
I'd like to redo this challenge, with updates in 2019. A new notebook has been added in `notebooks` to redo the analysis, now with the help of models.
